# Authentication Logout Fix

## Problem Fixed
âœ… **Users no longer get automatically logged out from the app**

## Root Cause
The authentication system was automatically logging out users when their temporary password expired, even if they were actively using the application.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Password Expiry Handling
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Before:** Automatic logout when temporary password expired
- **After:** Show password change dialog and allow continued app usage

### 2. Improved User Experience
- Users can now continue using the app even with expired temporary passwords
- Password change dialog appears but doesn't force logout
- More graceful handling of authentication states

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Added better console logging for authentication events
- Clearer messages about password expiry status
- Improved debugging for authentication issues

## Technical Details

### Modified Function: `checkPasswordChangeRequired`
```typescript
// OLD BEHAVIOR - Force logout on expiry
if (expiryDate <= now) {
  console.log('Temporary password expired, logging out');
  signOut(); // This was causing automatic logouts
  return;
}

// NEW BEHAVIOR - Show dialog, allow continued usage
if (expiryDate <= now) {
  console.log('Temporary password expired, showing urgent change dialog');
  setShowChangePasswordDialog(true);
  // User can continue using the app
}
```

### Benefits
1. **No More Unexpected Logouts:** Users stay logged in and can complete their work
2. **Better UX:** Password change prompts are shown without disrupting workflow
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Expired passwords don't break the application flow
4. **Improved Stability:** Reduces authentication-related crashes and errors

## Testing the Fix

1. **Login to the app** - Should stay logged in
2. **Navigate between pages** - No unexpected logouts
3. **Use chat/tickets** - Functionality works without interruption
4. **Check browser console** - Better authentication logging

## Additional Improvements

### Session Persistence
- Enhanced Supabase configuration for better session handling
- Improved token refresh behavior
- Better real-time connection stability

### Error Handling
- More robust error handling in authentication flow
- Better recovery from authentication conflicts
- Improved user profile loading

The authentication system now provides a stable, user-friendly experience without unexpected logouts! ðŸš€
