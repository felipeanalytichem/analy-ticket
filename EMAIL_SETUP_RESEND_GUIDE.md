# 📧 Email Setup Guide - Resend Integration

## 🎯 **Goal**: Get Real Email Delivery Working

Currently your email function is working perfectly but running in **simulation mode**. This guide will help you configure **Resend** to send actual emails to users.

---

## ✅ **Current Status**
- ✅ Email function deployed and working (no more EarlyDrop)
- ✅ Function processes emails successfully 
- ⚠️ **Running in simulation mode** - emails are logged but not delivered
- 🎯 **Next step**: Configure Resend for real email delivery

---

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Setup**

### **Step 1: Create Resend Account (2 minutes)**

1. **Go to Resend**: https://resend.com/
2. **Sign up** with your email address
3. **Verify your email** (check inbox/spam)
4. **Complete account setup**

**Why Resend?**
- ✅ **Free tier**: 3,000 emails/month (perfect for your needs)
- ✅ **Developer-friendly**: Made for applications like yours
- ✅ **Great deliverability**: Emails won't go to spam
- ✅ **Edge Function compatible**: Works perfectly with Supabase

---

### **Step 2: Get Your API Key (1 minute)**

1. **Login to Resend dashboard**
2. **Go to "API Keys"** in the sidebar
3. **Click "Create API Key"**
4. **Name it**: `ACS-Ticket-System` 
5. **Copy the API key** (starts with `re_`)

⚠️ **Important**: Save this key securely - you'll only see it once!

---

### **Step 3: Configure Domain (Optional but Recommended)**

**Option A: Use Your Domain (Recommended)**
1. **Go to "Domains"** in Resend dashboard
2. **Click "Add Domain"**
3. **Enter**: `analytichem.com`
4. **Follow DNS setup instructions** (add DNS records)
5. **Wait for verification** (can take a few minutes)

**Option B: Use Resend Default (Quick Start)**
- Skip this step to use Resend's default sending domain
- Emails will come from `@resend.dev` (works fine for testing)

---

### **Step 4: Configure Supabase (Replace Your API Key)**

**Replace the placeholder with your real API key:**

```bash
npx supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here --project-ref plbmgjqitlxedsmdqpld
```

**Example:**
```bash
npx supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_AbCdEf123456 --project-ref plbmgjqitlxedsmdqpld
```

**✅ Already configured:**
- ✅ `FROM_EMAIL=suporte@analytichem.com`
- ✅ Email function deployed with Resend integration

---

### **Step 5: Test Real Email Delivery**

1. **Go to your application**: https://acsticket-nolllpxx3-felipeanalytichems-projects.vercel.app
2. **Admin Dashboard → User Management**
3. **Create a new user** with your real email address
4. **Check your email inbox** (including spam folder)

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ You should receive a **real email** with user invitation
- ✅ Check browser console - should show "Email sent successfully via Resend"
- ✅ Check Supabase function logs - should show successful delivery

---

## 🔍 **Verification & Troubleshooting**

### **Check Function Logs**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Functions → send-email
2. Look for logs like:
   - `✅ Email sent successfully via Resend to your@email.com`
   - `📧 Resend API configured: Yes`

### **Check Resend Dashboard**
1. Login to Resend dashboard
2. Go to **"Emails"** tab
3. You should see your sent emails with delivery status

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**❌ Issue**: Still in simulation mode
```
"message": "Email processed successfully (simulation mode)"
```
**✅ Solution**: Make sure you replaced `your-actual-resend-api-key-here` with your real API key

**❌ Issue**: "Resend error: Invalid API key"
**✅ Solution**: 
- Check your API key is correct
- Make sure it starts with `re_`
- Regenerate API key if needed

**❌ Issue**: "Domain not verified"
**✅ Solution**: 
- Either set up DNS records for your domain
- Or use Resend's default domain temporarily
