# Error Recovery Manual Test Guide

This document provides manual testing scenarios to verify the comprehensive error recovery implementation in the UserManagement component.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Network Error Recovery

**Steps:**
1. Open the User Management page as an admin
2. Disconnect your internet connection
3. Try to refresh the page or perform any user operation
4. Reconnect your internet
5. Click the "Retry" button

**Expected Results:**
- Error message appears with network connectivity status
- "Test Connection" button shows disconnected status
- After reconnecting, retry should work
- Recovery actions should be logged in console

### 2. Authentication Token Refresh

**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Clear the Supabase auth token from localStorage
4. Try to perform a user operation (create, edit, delete)

**Expected Results:**
- Operation should automatically attempt token refresh
- If refresh succeeds, operation continues
- If refresh fails, clear error message with authentication context

### 3. Database Connection Issues

**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Block requests to supabase.co domain
4. Try to load users or perform operations
5. Unblock the requests
6. Click retry

**Expected Results:**
- Database error classification in console logs
- Automatic retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Recovery information displayed in error UI
- Success after unblocking

### 4. Exponential Backoff Verification

**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools console
2. Simulate network errors by blocking requests
3. Observe the retry timing in console logs

**Expected Results:**
- First retry: ~1 second delay
- Second retry: ~2 second delay  
- Third retry: ~4 second delay
- Console logs show retry attempt numbers and delays

### 5. Error Logging and Statistics

**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools console
2. Cause various types of errors (network, auth, database)
3. Check console for detailed error logs

**Expected Results:**
- Structured error logs with timestamps
- Error classification (network, authentication, database, etc.)
- Session ID tracking
- Context information (operation, user data, etc.)

### 6. Connectivity Testing

**Steps:**
1. Cause a network error to show error state
2. Click "Test Connection" button
3. Observe connectivity status indicator

**Expected Results:**
- Button shows loading state during test
- Green/red indicator shows connection status
- Toast notification with test results

### 7. Recovery Actions Display

**Steps:**
1. Cause an authentication error
2. Observe the error display panel

**Expected Results:**
- Shows number of recovery attempts
- Lists recovery actions taken (e.g., "token_refreshed")
- Shows total time spent on recovery
- Displays connectivity status

## Console Commands for Testing

You can also test the error recovery service directly in the browser console:

```javascript
// Test network error recovery
errorRecoveryService.executeWithRetry(
  async () => {
    throw new Error('Network connection failed');
  },
  { test: 'manual' }
).then(result => console.log('Result:', result));

// Test connectivity
errorRecoveryService.testConnectivity()
  .then(connected => console.log('Connected:', connected));

// Get error statistics
console.log('Error Stats:', errorRecoveryService.getErrorStats());

// Get error log
console.log('Error Log:', errorRecoveryService.getErrorLog());
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Network errors trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Authentication errors attempt token refresh transparently
- [ ] Database errors are properly classified and retried
- [ ] Error UI shows detailed recovery information
- [ ] Connectivity testing works correctly
- [ ] Error logging captures detailed context
- [ ] Recovery actions are tracked and displayed
- [ ] Manual retry button works after failures
- [ ] Success notifications show attempt count when > 1
- [ ] Console logs provide debugging information

## Performance Verification

- [ ] User loading completes within 3 seconds on success
- [ ] Error recovery doesn't block UI interactions
- [ ] Retry delays follow exponential backoff pattern
- [ ] Error log is limited to prevent memory issues
- [ ] Recovery operations don't cause infinite loops

## Error Types Covered

- [x] Network connection failures
- [x] Authentication token expiration
- [x] Database query failures
- [x] Timeout errors
- [x] Authorization/permission errors
- [x] Validation errors (non-retryable)
- [x] Unknown errors (non-retryable)

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed Features:**
- Comprehensive error classification
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Authentication token refresh handling
- Detailed error logging with context
- Connectivity testing
- Recovery actions tracking
- Enhanced error UI with recovery information
- Integration with UserManagement operations
- Error statistics and debugging tools

The error recovery system is fully implemented and provides robust handling of various failure scenarios while maintaining a good user experience.
