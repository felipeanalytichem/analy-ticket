# User Management Performance Test Guide

## Objective
Verify that the User Management page loads within 3 seconds for admin users and provides optimal user experience.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Initial Page Load Performance
**Steps:**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab and clear any existing requests
3. Navigate to `/admin/users` as an admin user
4. Measure the time from navigation to when the page is fully loaded

**Expected Results:**
- Page should load within 3 seconds
- Skeleton loading should appear immediately
- No flickering between loading states
- User list should appear smoothly after data loads

### 2. Progressive Loading Test
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/admin/users`
2. Observe the loading sequence

**Expected Results:**
- Skeleton appears immediately (< 100ms)
- Search and filter controls load quickly
- User list populates progressively
- No blank screens or loading spinners after skeleton

### 3. Search Performance Test
**Steps:**
1. Load the User Management page with 50+ users
2. Type in the search box rapidly
3. Observe response time and smoothness

**Expected Results:**
- Search input responds immediately to typing
- Results update smoothly with debouncing (300ms delay)
- No lag or freezing during rapid typing
- Filter results appear quickly (< 100ms after debounce)

### 4. Large Dataset Performance
**Steps:**
1. Test with 100+ users in the system
2. Apply various filters (role, search terms)
3. Measure response times

**Expected Results:**
- Initial load still under 3 seconds
- Filtering operations complete in < 50ms
- Smooth scrolling through user list
- No performance degradation with large datasets

### 5. Network Conditions Test
**Steps:**
1. Use browser dev tools to simulate slow network (Slow 3G)
2. Navigate to User Management page
3. Observe loading behavior

**Expected Results:**
- Skeleton loading provides good perceived performance
- Progressive loading works well on slow connections
- Automatic retry works for network failures
- User gets clear feedback about loading state

## Performance Benchmarks

### Loading Time Targets:
- **Skeleton appearance**: < 100ms
- **Initial data load**: < 3 seconds
- **Search filtering**: < 100ms (after 300ms debounce)
- **Role filtering**: < 50ms
- **Component re-renders**: Minimized through memoization

### Memory Usage:
- No memory leaks during normal usage
- Efficient cleanup of event listeners
- Proper component unmounting

## Optimization Features Implemented

### 1. Progressive Loading
- Skeleton loading for better perceived performance
- Parallel loading of users and temp password columns
- Optimized database queries with field selection and limits

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- Memoized filtering operations
- Reduced component re-renders with React.memo
- Stable callback references with useCallback

### 3. Error Handling & Retry
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Network error detection and handling
- Performance monitoring and warnings

### 4. Data Management
- Efficient user data transformation
- Optimized search and filter algorithms
- Reduced unnecessary API calls

## Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Page loads within 3 seconds on normal connection
- [ ] Skeleton loading appears immediately
- [ ] No flickering between loading states
- [ ] Search input is responsive with debouncing
