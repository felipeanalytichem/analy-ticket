MANUAL TEST EXECUTION GUIDE
==========================

Prerequisites:
- Application running in development mode
- Admin user account with category management permissions
- Browser developer tools open to monitor console
- At least one category with subcategories available

Execution Steps:
1. Run each test scenario in sequence
2. Document any failures or unexpected behavior
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors after each step
4. Verify database state using admin tools if available
5. Take screenshots of any error states encountered

Success Criteria:
- All test scenarios pass without errors
- No JavaScript console errors during execution
- Database state remains consistent
- UI provides appropriate feedback for all operations
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully

Failure Investigation:
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify network requests in browser dev tools
- Check database logs for any constraint violations
- Document exact steps to reproduce any failures
- Test in different browsers if issues are browser-specific

Post-Test Validation:
- Verify no test data corruption in database
- Confirm all test fields can be cleaned up
- Check that normal category operations still work
- Validate that changes don't affect other system areas
