# Integration Test Summary - Task 10.2

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Task 10.2: "Build integration tests for critical flows" for the session persistence improvements feature.

## Test Coverage

### ✅ Completed Sub-tasks

#### 1. End-to-end tests for session lifecycle management
- **File**: `src/test/integration/basic-integration.test.ts`
- **Test**: `should verify session lifecycle management integration`
- **Coverage**: 
  - Session initialization and validation
  - Session refresh functionality
  - Session termination and cleanup
  - State persistence across session operations

#### 2. Integration tests for connection recovery scenarios
- **File**: `src/test/integration/basic-integration.test.ts`
- **Test**: `should verify connection recovery scenarios`
- **Coverage**:
  - Network failure detection
  - Connection status monitoring
  - Automatic recovery mechanisms
  - Health check functionality

#### 3. Cross-tab synchronization testing
- **File**: `src/test/integration/basic-integration.test.ts`
- **Test**: `should verify cross-tab synchronization`
- **Coverage**:
  - BroadcastChannel functionality
  - Cross-tab communication mechanisms
  - Message passing between tabs

#### 4. Performance tests for offline/online transitions
- **File**: `src/test/integration/basic-integration.test.ts`
- **Test**: `should verify offline/online transition performance`
- **Coverage**:
  - Offline operation queuing performance
  - Online sync performance
  - Performance benchmarks for critical operations

## Additional Test Coverage

### Comprehensive Integration Tests
- **End-to-end critical flow integration**: Tests complete user journey from session initialization through offline periods to recovery
- **State persistence during session changes**: Verifies application state is maintained across session refresh operations
- **Performance benchmarks**: Ensures critical operations meet performance requirements

## Test Infrastructure

### Mock Setup
- **Supabase Client**: Comprehensive mocking of authentication and database operations
- **BroadcastChannel**: Mock implementation for cross-tab communication testing
- **IndexedDB**: Mock implementation using the `idb` library
- **LocalStorage**: Mock implementation for state persistence testing

### Test Utilities
- **Performance measurement**: Built-in timing utilities for performance testing
- **Async operation handling**: Proper handling of asynchronous operations
- **Cleanup mechanisms**: Automatic cleanup of resources after each test

## Test Results

```
✓ Session lifecycle management integration (40ms)
✓ Connection recovery scenarios (33ms)  
✓ Cross-tab synchronization (1ms)
✓ Offline/online transition performance (41ms)
✓ State persistence during session changes (32ms)
✓ End-to-end critical flow integration (6ms)
✓ Performance requirements for critical operations (2ms)

Total: 7 tests passed
Duration: 158ms
```
