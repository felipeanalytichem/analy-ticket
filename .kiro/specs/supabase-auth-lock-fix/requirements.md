# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical authentication error in the Analy-Ticket application where Supabase authentication is failing with "TypeError: this._acquireLock is not a function". This error is preventing users from logging in, accessing the application, and performing any authenticated operations. The issue appears to be related to session management and authentication initialization problems that are causing cascading failures throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to authenticate successfully without encountering JavaScript errors, so that I can access the application and perform my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the Supabase authentication SHALL NOT throw "_acquireLock is not a function" errors
2. WHEN a user attempts to sign in THEN the authentication process SHALL complete without JavaScript errors
3. WHEN the AuthContext initializes THEN it SHALL properly handle session management without lock-related errors
4. IF authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly caught and handled gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without authentication-related console errors, so that I have confidence in the system's stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the browser console SHALL NOT display Supabase authentication errors
2. WHEN session initialization occurs THEN the GoTrueClient SHALL function properly without method errors
3. WHEN real-time connections are established THEN they SHALL not fail due to authentication lock issues
4. WHEN category initialization runs THEN it SHALL not fail due to authentication problems

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for authentication failures, so that the application remains functional even when authentication issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
2. WHEN session management encounters errors THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery mechanisms
3. WHEN Supabase client methods fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. IF authentication cannot be recovered THEN the system SHALL gracefully redirect users to the login page
