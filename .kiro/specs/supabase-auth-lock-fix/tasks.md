# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create enhanced Supabase client configuration with error handling







  - Update `src/lib/supabase.ts` to include comprehensive error handling and client initialization safeguards
  - Add client health validation and corruption detection mechanisms
  - Implement client reinitialization functionality for recovery scenarios
  - Add debug logging for authentication operations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement authentication error boundary and recovery service
  - Create `src/services/AuthErrorHandler.ts` to handle lock errors and other authentication failures
  - Implement session corruption detection and cleanup mechanisms
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed authentication attempts
  - Create fallback authentication flows for when primary methods fail
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 3. Refactor AuthContext to handle lock errors gracefully
  - Update `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to wrap authentication operations in try-catch blocks
  - Implement proper error state management and user feedback
  - Add session recovery mechanisms when lock errors are detected
  - Ensure proper cleanup of corrupted session data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 4. Create session recovery and validation service
  - Implement `src/services/SessionRecoveryService.ts` for detecting and recovering from session corruption
  - Add session integrity validation methods
  - Create storage cleanup utilities for corrupted authentication data
  - Implement client reinitialization with fresh configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring
  - Create `src/services/AuthErrorLogger.ts` for detailed error tracking and context collection
  - Implement error reporting with sanitized information (no sensitive data)
  - Add performance monitoring for authentication operations
  - Create diagnostic utilities for troubleshooting authentication issues
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Implement authentication health checks and diagnostics
  - Create `src/components/diagnostics/AuthHealthChecker.tsx` for real-time authentication status monitoring
  - Add proactive session validation to prevent lock errors
  - Implement authentication performance metrics collection
  - Create user-facing diagnostic tools for authentication troubleshooting
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive unit tests for authentication error handling
  - Write tests for `AuthErrorHandler` service with various error scenarios
  - Test session recovery mechanisms with mocked corruption scenarios
  - Add tests for client reinitialization and fallback authentication flows
  - Test error logging and monitoring functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 8. Create integration tests for authentication flow recovery
  - Test end-to-end authentication with simulated lock errors
  - Verify session recovery works across browser refreshes and tab switches
  - Test concurrent authentication attempts and race condition handling
  - Validate error boundaries prevent application crashes during auth failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 9. Add user-facing error recovery UI components
  - Create `src/components/auth/AuthErrorRecovery.tsx` for user-initiated recovery actions
  - Implement user-friendly error messages that don't expose technical details
  - Add manual retry buttons and alternative authentication options
  - Create loading states and progress indicators for recovery operations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.4_

- [ ] 10. Update application initialization to handle authentication failures gracefully
  - Modify `src/App.tsx` to include authentication error boundaries
  - Implement graceful degradation when authentication is unavailable
  - Add startup health checks for critical authentication components
  - Ensure application remains functional during authentication recovery
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 3.4_
