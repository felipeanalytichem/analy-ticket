# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the intelligent assignment system with advanced analytics, machine learning capabilities, and predictive assignment features. The system will provide deep insights into assignment effectiveness, predict optimal assignments using historical data, and offer advanced reporting capabilities for administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want advanced assignment analytics so that I can understand assignment patterns and optimize the system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing assignment analytics THEN the system SHALL display assignment success rates over time
2. WHEN analyzing assignment patterns THEN the system SHALL show agent performance trends and workload distribution
3. WHEN reviewing assignment effectiveness THEN the system SHALL calculate and display average resolution times by assignment method
4. WHEN examining system performance THEN the system SHALL show assignment algorithm confidence scores and accuracy metrics
5. WHEN accessing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by date range, agent, category, and priority

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want predictive assignment recommendations so that I can proactively optimize ticket distribution based on historical patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes historical data THEN it SHALL identify patterns in successful assignments
2. WHEN predicting optimal assignments THEN the system SHALL consider seasonal trends and workload patterns
3. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals and accuracy estimates
4. WHEN displaying predictions THEN the system SHALL show expected resolution times and success probabilities
5. WHEN predictions are available THEN the system SHALL highlight high-confidence recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want automated assignment optimization so that the system can continuously improve assignment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects suboptimal assignments THEN it SHALL suggest rule adjustments
2. WHEN assignment patterns change THEN the system SHALL recommend weight adjustments for the scoring algorithm
3. WHEN new data is available THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain prediction models
4. WHEN optimization suggestions are made THEN the system SHALL provide impact estimates
5. WHEN implementing optimizations THEN the system SHALL track before/after performance metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive assignment reporting so that I can generate insights for management and process improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide assignment volume and distribution metrics
2. WHEN creating performance reports THEN the system SHALL include agent efficiency and customer satisfaction correlations
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support CSV, PDF, and JSON formats
4. WHEN scheduling reports THEN the system SHALL allow automated report generation and delivery
5. WHEN viewing reports THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts and drill-down capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an agent, I want personalized assignment insights so that I can understand my performance and improve my efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my dashboard THEN the system SHALL show my assignment success rate and trends
2. WHEN analyzing my performance THEN the system SHALL display my strengths and improvement areas
3. WHEN comparing performance THEN the system SHALL show anonymous benchmarks against team averages
4. WHEN receiving assignments THEN the system SHALL explain why tickets were assigned to me
5. WHEN reviewing history THEN the system SHALL show my resolution time trends and customer feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want machine learning model management so that I can monitor and maintain the predictive assignment capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing ML models THEN the system SHALL display model performance metrics and accuracy
2. WHEN models need retraining THEN the system SHALL provide automated retraining schedules
3. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest actions
4. WHEN deploying new models THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing and gradual rollout
5. WHEN monitoring models THEN the system SHALL track prediction accuracy and drift detection
