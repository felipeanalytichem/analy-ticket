# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The user management page is experiencing flickering and loading issues that negatively impact the user experience. The page shows a loading spinner that appears to flicker between different states, and users report that the page sometimes fails to load correctly. This spec addresses the root causes of these issues and implements a stable, smooth loading experience for the user management interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the user management page to load smoothly without flickering, so that I can efficiently manage users without visual distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user management page loads THEN the system SHALL display a single, stable loading state without flickering
2. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL show a consistent loading indicator that doesn't change states rapidly
3. WHEN the page transitions from loading to loaded THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth visual transition without jarring changes
4. WHEN network requests are in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous loading states from overlapping

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want reliable error handling on the user management page, so that I can understand and resolve any issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with retry options
2. WHEN retrying failed requests THEN the system SHALL show appropriate feedback without causing visual flickering
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a stable error state without loading loops
4. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error information and recovery options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the user management page to handle state transitions gracefully, so that the interface remains stable during all operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between different user management operations THEN the system SHALL maintain visual stability
2. WHEN user data updates THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without causing page-wide re-renders
3. WHEN filters or search terms change THEN the system SHALL update results smoothly without flickering
4. WHEN dialogs open or close THEN the system SHALL not trigger unnecessary re-renders of the main component

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want optimized performance on the user management page, so that operations are fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL minimize the number of API calls and re-renders
2. WHEN user data changes THEN the system SHALL update only the affected components
3. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL provide stable progress feedback
4. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL properly clean up subscriptions and prevent memory leaks
