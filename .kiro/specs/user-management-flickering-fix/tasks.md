# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create consolidated loading state manager hook





  - Implement `useConsolidatedLoading` hook that manages all loading states in one place
  - Replace multiple loading states with single, predictable loading state
  - Add proper state transitions to prevent flickering
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Optimize UserManagement component structure





  - Wrap component with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Extract user list rendering into separate memoized component
  - Implement useMemo for filtered users computation
  - Add useCallback for all event handlers to stabilize references
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.2_


- [x] 3. Implement stable loading UI patterns




  - Create consistent loading indicator component that doesn't flicker
  - Add smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
  - Implement skeleton loading for better perceived performance
  - Remove overlapping loading states that cause visual conflicts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_
-

- [x] 4. Enhance error handling and retry logic




  - Consolidate error states into single error boundary
  - Improve retry mechanism to prevent rapid state changes
  - Add proper error recovery without causing re-renders
  - Implement graceful degradation for partial data loading
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Optimize authentication state handling





  - Prevent authentication loading from conflicting with data loading
  - Add proper guards for authentication state changes
  - Implement stable authentication error display
  - Cache authentication checks to reduce redundant calls
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.1_

- [x] 6. Implement form state isolation





  - Extract user form into separate component with isolated state
  - Prevent form operations from triggering main component re-renders
  - Add optimistic updates for better user experience
  - Implement proper form state cleanup on dialog close
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Add performance monitoring and cleanup





  - Implement proper cleanup of subscriptions and timers
  - Add performance monitoring for render cycles
  - Optimize search and filter operations with debouncing
  - Add memory leak prevention for component unmounting
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive tests for stability





  - Write unit tests for loading state transitions
  - Add integration tests for user management workflows
  - Implement visual regression tests to prevent flickering
  - Create performance tests to ensure optimization effectiveness
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.3, 4.1_
