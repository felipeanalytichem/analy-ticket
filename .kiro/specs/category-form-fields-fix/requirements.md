# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Category Management system's custom form fields functionality is not working properly. Users cannot create new form fields, save existing fields, or use the required toggle functionality in the "Manage Fields" interface. This critical issue prevents administrators from configuring dynamic forms for subcategories, which is essential for collecting specific information based on ticket types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new custom form fields for subcategories, so that I can collect specific information relevant to different ticket types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Manage Fields" on a subcategory THEN the form builder dialog SHALL open successfully
2. WHEN I click "Add Field" in the form builder THEN a new form field SHALL be added to the interface
3. WHEN I configure a new field with type, label, and options THEN the field SHALL be saved to the interface state
4. WHEN I click "Save Schema" THEN the new fields SHALL be persisted to the database
5. WHEN I reopen the form builder THEN the previously saved fields SHALL be displayed correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to edit existing form fields, so that I can update field configurations as business requirements change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the form builder for a subcategory with existing fields THEN all existing fields SHALL be displayed correctly
2. WHEN I modify a field's label, type, or options THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the interface immediately
3. WHEN I toggle the "Required" switch for a field THEN the field's required status SHALL update correctly
4. WHEN I toggle the "Enabled" switch for a field THEN the field's enabled status SHALL update correctly
5. WHEN I save the form schema THEN all field modifications SHALL be persisted to the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to delete form fields that are no longer needed, so that I can keep the forms clean and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the delete button on a form field THEN the field SHALL be removed from the interface immediately
2. WHEN I save the form schema after deleting fields THEN the deleted fields SHALL be removed from the database
3. WHEN I reopen the form builder THEN the deleted fields SHALL not appear in the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the form builder interface to handle data correctly, so that I don't encounter duplicate fields or data corruption issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add multiple fields THEN no duplicate field IDs SHALL be created
2. WHEN I save and reload the form builder THEN no duplicate fields SHALL appear in the interface
3. WHEN field data is loaded from the database THEN it SHALL be properly parsed and displayed
4. WHEN I interact with form controls THEN the state updates SHALL be consistent and reliable
5. IF there are data inconsistencies THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want clear feedback when form operations succeed or fail, so that I can understand the status of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I successfully save form fields THEN a success message SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN a save operation fails THEN an error message SHALL be displayed with details
3. WHEN I perform field operations THEN loading states SHALL be shown appropriately
4. WHEN there are validation errors THEN they SHALL be clearly communicated to the user
