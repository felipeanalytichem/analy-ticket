# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The user management page is currently displaying "Name not available" for all users instead of showing their actual names. This creates a poor user experience for administrators who need to identify and manage users effectively. The system should properly retrieve and display user names from the database, with appropriate fallback handling for cases where names are genuinely unavailable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see actual user names in the user management page, so that I can easily identify and manage users in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views the user management page THEN the system SHALL display actual user names instead of "Name not available"
2. WHEN a user has a full name in their profile THEN the system SHALL display the full name in the user list
3. WHEN a user has only a first name or last name THEN the system SHALL display the available name components
4. WHEN a user has no name information THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful fallback like "No name provided" or use the email username portion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the user list to handle missing name data gracefully, so that the interface remains professional and informative even when user data is incomplete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's name data is null or empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate fallback message
2. WHEN the system cannot retrieve name data due to database issues THEN the system SHALL display an error state with retry options
3. WHEN displaying fallback text THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and messaging across all user entries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the user management page to load user data efficiently, so that I can quickly access user information without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user management page loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve all necessary user data in a single optimized query
2. WHEN user data is being loaded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
3. WHEN user data fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms
