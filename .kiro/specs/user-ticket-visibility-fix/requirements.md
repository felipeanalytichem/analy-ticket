# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical security and user experience issue in the ticket management system where users can currently see all tickets in the system instead of being restricted to only their own tickets. This fix ensures proper data privacy and improves the user experience by showing only relevant tickets to each user. The system should enforce proper ticket ownership filtering for end users while maintaining appropriate visibility for agents and administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to see only my own tickets so that I have privacy and can focus on my relevant support requests without seeing other users' tickets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the tickets page THEN the system SHALL display only tickets created by that user
2. WHEN a user accesses ticket lists THEN the system SHALL filter tickets by the current user's ID
3. WHEN a user searches for tickets THEN the system SHALL restrict search results to only their own tickets
4. WHEN a user tries to access a ticket detail that doesn't belong to them THEN the system SHALL deny access and show an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to see my tickets in all relevant statuses with appropriate time-based filtering so that I can track both active and recently completed support requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their tickets THEN the system SHALL show tickets with status "open", "in_progress", and "resolved"
2. WHEN displaying user tickets THEN the system SHALL show "closed" tickets only if they were closed within the last 7 days
3. WHEN a ticket has been closed for more than 7 days THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the user's ticket view
4. WHEN calculating the 7-day visibility period THEN the system SHALL use the ticket's closed_at timestamp as the reference point
5. WHEN a user's ticket status changes to closed THEN the system SHALL continue showing it for exactly 7 days from the closure date

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to maintain my current ticket visibility so that I can continue to see all tickets assigned to me or in my queue for support operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent views tickets THEN the system SHALL display tickets according to their role permissions (assigned tickets, queue tickets, etc.)
2. WHEN an agent accesses ticket details THEN the system SHALL allow access to any ticket they have permission to handle
3. WHEN the ticket visibility fix is applied THEN the system SHALL NOT affect agent ticket access patterns
4. WHEN agents use ticket search and filtering THEN the system SHALL maintain their current broad access capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to view tickets assigned to other agents in a separate menu so that I can collaborate and provide support when needed without cluttering my main ticket view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide a separate menu option to view "All Agent Tickets"
2. WHEN an agent selects "All Agent Tickets" THEN the system SHALL display tickets assigned to any agent in the system
3. WHEN viewing all agent tickets THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which agent each ticket is assigned to
4. WHEN an agent views another agent's ticket details THEN the system SHALL allow read access but may restrict certain modification actions
5. WHEN displaying all agent tickets THEN the system SHALL include filtering options by assigned agent, status, and priority

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to maintain full ticket visibility so that I can oversee all support operations and manage the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views tickets THEN the system SHALL display all tickets in the system regardless of ownership
2. WHEN an administrator accesses any ticket detail THEN the system SHALL allow full access
3. WHEN the ticket visibility fix is applied THEN the system SHALL NOT restrict administrator access to any tickets
4. WHEN administrators use reporting and analytics THEN the system SHALL continue to show comprehensive data across all tickets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and security measures so that unauthorized ticket access attempts are properly blocked and logged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access a ticket that doesn't belong to them THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
2. WHEN unauthorized ticket access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the security event for audit purposes
3. WHEN ticket filtering fails THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message and not expose other users' tickets
4. WHEN database queries for tickets are executed THEN the system SHALL include proper WHERE clauses to enforce ownership filtering
