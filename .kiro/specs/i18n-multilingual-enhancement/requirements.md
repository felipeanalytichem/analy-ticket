# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the internationalization (i18n) capabilities of the Analy-Ticket system by expanding language support, identifying and replacing hardcoded text strings with translation keys, and improving the overall multilingual user experience. The system currently supports 6 languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Dutch) but has numerous hardcoded strings throughout the application that need to be properly internationalized.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hardcoded Text Detection and Replacement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and replace all hardcoded text strings in the application with proper translation keys, so that the entire application can be properly localized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the translation audit script is executed THEN the system SHALL identify all hardcoded text strings in React components, TypeScript files, and JavaScript files
2. WHEN hardcoded strings are detected THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with file locations, line numbers, and suggested translation keys
3. WHEN replacing hardcoded strings THEN the system SHALL use the SafeTranslation component or useTranslation hook for all user-facing text
4. WHEN hardcoded strings are replaced THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and functionality
5. WHEN translation keys are created THEN they SHALL follow a hierarchical naming convention (e.g., "tickets.create.title", "admin.users.deleteConfirm")

### Requirement 2: Extended Language Support

**User Story:** As a global user, I want the application to support additional languages beyond the current 6, so that I can use the system in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new languages THEN the system SHALL support at least 4 additional languages: Italian (it-IT), Japanese (ja-JP), Chinese Simplified (zh-CN), and Arabic (ar-SA)
2. WHEN a new language is added THEN the system SHALL include complete translation files with all existing translation keys
3. WHEN a new language is selected THEN the system SHALL properly handle right-to-left (RTL) text direction for Arabic
4. WHEN language files are created THEN they SHALL include all sections: common, auth, tickets, dashboard, admin, notifications, chat, knowledge, reports, and errors
5. WHEN translations are provided THEN they SHALL be contextually appropriate and culturally sensitive

### Requirement 3: Translation Completeness and Quality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all text in the application to be properly translated in my selected language, so that I have a consistent and professional experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing translation files THEN the system SHALL ensure 100% coverage of all user-facing text strings
2. WHEN translations are missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default language (en-US) gracefully
3. WHEN translation keys are used THEN they SHALL support interpolation for dynamic content (e.g., user names, dates, numbers)
4. WHEN pluralization is needed THEN the system SHALL handle singular/plural forms correctly for each language
5. WHEN date and number formatting is displayed THEN it SHALL respect the locale-specific formatting conventions

### Requirement 4: Translation Management Tools

**User Story:** As a developer or translator, I want automated tools to manage translations efficiently, so that I can maintain translation quality and completeness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running translation audits THEN the system SHALL detect missing translation keys across all language files
2. WHEN new translation keys are added THEN the system SHALL automatically add placeholder entries to all language files
3. WHEN duplicate translation keys exist THEN the system SHALL identify and report them for consolidation
4. WHEN translation files are updated THEN the system SHALL validate JSON syntax and key consistency
5. WHEN generating translation reports THEN they SHALL include statistics on completion percentage per language

### Requirement 5: Dynamic Language Switching

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch languages dynamically without refreshing the page, so that I can quickly change my language preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a different language THEN the interface SHALL update immediately without page refresh
2. WHEN language is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the selection in localStorage
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL detect and apply the user's preferred language from browser settings or saved preferences
4. WHEN switching languages THEN all UI components SHALL re-render with the new translations
5. WHEN language switching occurs THEN form data and user input SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and RTL Support

**User Story:** As a user who reads right-to-left languages, I want the interface to properly support RTL text direction, so that the application is usable and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Arabic language is selected THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to RTL text direction
2. WHEN in RTL mode THEN layout elements SHALL mirror appropriately (navigation, buttons, icons)
3. WHEN RTL is active THEN text alignment SHALL be right-aligned for Arabic content
4. WHEN switching between LTR and RTL languages THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and maintain layout integrity
5. WHEN using RTL THEN accessibility features SHALL continue to work correctly with screen readers

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle translation errors gracefully, so that missing translations don't break the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL display the key name as fallback text
2. WHEN translation loading fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default language (en-US)
3. WHEN interpolation fails THEN the system SHALL display the raw translation string without breaking the interface
4. WHEN language files are corrupted THEN the system SHALL log errors and use fallback translations
5. WHEN network issues prevent translation loading THEN the system SHALL use cached translations or fallbacks

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want language switching and translation loading to be fast and efficient, so that the application remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN only the selected language file SHALL be loaded initially
2. WHEN switching languages THEN translation files SHALL be loaded on-demand and cached
3. WHEN translation files are large THEN they SHALL be split into logical chunks for lazy loading
4. WHEN caching translations THEN the system SHALL implement efficient memory management
5. WHEN updating translations THEN the system SHALL invalidate caches appropriately
