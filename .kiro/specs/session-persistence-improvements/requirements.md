# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Analy-Ticket application currently experiences issues where after periods of inactivity, users need to refresh the page to continue using the platform. This creates a poor user experience and interrupts workflow. This enhancement will implement robust session management, connection persistence, and automatic recovery mechanisms to ensure the application remains functional even after periods of inactivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to remain active and functional even after periods of inactivity, so that I don't need to refresh the page to continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is inactive for up to 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL maintain their session without requiring refresh
2. WHEN a user's session is about to expire THEN the system SHALL show a warning dialog with option to extend
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page gracefully without errors
4. WHEN a user returns after inactivity THEN all application functionality SHALL work without page refresh
5. IF the session token is invalid THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic token refresh before showing errors

### Requirement 2: Connection State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically handle connection issues and recover gracefully, so that I can continue working without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the network connection is lost THEN the system SHALL detect the disconnection within 10 seconds
2. WHEN the connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and sync data
3. WHEN API calls fail due to connection issues THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL queue operations and retry when reconnected
5. IF connection issues persist THEN the system SHALL show appropriate user feedback and recovery options

### Requirement 3: Automatic Token Refresh

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication tokens to be refreshed automatically, so that I don't get logged out unexpectedly during work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token is about to expire THEN the system SHALL refresh it automatically in the background
2. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL update all stored tokens securely
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL attempt retry up to 3 times before requiring re-login
4. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN token refresh SHALL be synchronized across all tabs
5. IF refresh tokens are expired THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 4: Application State Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my application state to be preserved during connection issues, so that I don't lose my work or current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL preserve current page state and user inputs
2. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL restore the previous application state
3. WHEN forms are being filled THEN the system SHALL auto-save drafts locally
4. WHEN navigation occurs during connection issues THEN the system SHALL queue navigation and execute when connected
5. IF state restoration fails THEN the system SHALL provide options to recover or start fresh

### Requirement 5: Real-time Connection Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to know the connection status of the application, so that I understand when issues might occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is connected THEN the system SHALL show a subtle connection indicator
2. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show a clear offline indicator
3. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL show reconnection progress
4. WHEN connection is unstable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate warnings
5. IF connection quality is poor THEN the system SHALL suggest actions to improve experience

### Requirement 6: Background Sync and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to sync data in the background and recover from errors automatically, so that my work is always up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL sync changes in the background
2. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry with intelligent backoff strategies
3. WHEN conflicts occur during sync THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically or prompt user
4. WHEN coming back online THEN the system SHALL sync all pending changes
5. IF sync fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL provide manual sync options

### Requirement 7: Error Recovery and Fallback

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to recover gracefully from errors and provide fallback options, so that I can continue working even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options
2. WHEN components fail to load THEN the system SHALL show error boundaries with retry options
3. WHEN data loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide cached data when available
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL offer safe recovery modes
5. IF all recovery attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance for manual resolution

### Requirement 8: Performance During Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remain responsive during connection issues and recovery, so that I can continue working efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recovering from connection issues THEN the system SHALL maintain UI responsiveness
2. WHEN syncing data THEN the system SHALL not block user interactions
3. WHEN retrying operations THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
4. WHEN loading cached data THEN the system SHALL display it within 500ms
5. IF recovery is taking long THEN the system SHALL provide options to work offline

### Requirement 9: Cross-Tab Session Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want session state to be synchronized across multiple browser tabs, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of which tab I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging in on one tab THEN all other tabs SHALL update their authentication state
2. WHEN logging out on one tab THEN all other tabs SHALL redirect to login
3. WHEN session expires on one tab THEN all tabs SHALL handle the expiration consistently
4. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN all tabs SHALL receive the updated tokens
5. IF one tab loses connection THEN other tabs SHALL continue working normally

### Requirement 10: Offline Capability

**User Story:** As a user, I want to continue viewing and working with previously loaded data when offline, so that temporary connection issues don't completely stop my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN going offline THEN the system SHALL allow viewing of previously loaded data
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL cache user inputs and queue actions
3. WHEN coming back online THEN the system SHALL sync all queued actions
4. WHEN offline for extended periods THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate messaging
5. IF offline actions conflict with server state THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options
