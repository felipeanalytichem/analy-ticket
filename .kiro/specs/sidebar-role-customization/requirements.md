# Sidebar Role Customization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for customizing the sidebar navigation menu based on user roles to provide a more tailored and intuitive user experience for different types of users in the Analy-Ticket system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Agent Role Customization

**User Story:** As an agent, I want the sidebar to be optimized for my workflow, so that I can efficiently manage tickets and access relevant tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent logs in THEN the main page should be "Agent Dashboard" instead of "Dashboard"
2. WHEN an agent views the sidebar THEN the "My Tickets" menu item should be hidden
3. WHEN an agent accesses the system THEN they should see agent-specific menu items prominently
4. WHEN an agent navigates THEN the default landing page should be the Agent Dashboard

### Requirement 2: User Role Customization

**User Story:** As a regular user, I want to see only relevant menu options, so that I can focus on creating and tracking my tickets without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN they should see "My Tickets" as a primary navigation option
2. WHEN a user views the sidebar THEN the "Agent Dashboard" menu item should be hidden
3. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN they should not see agent-specific functionality
4. WHEN a user navigates THEN they should have easy access to ticket creation and tracking

### Requirement 3: Admin Role Customization

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want clear access to analytics and administrative functions, so that I can effectively manage the system and monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN an admin views the sidebar THEN they should see all administrative menu options
3. WHEN an admin accesses analytics THEN they should see comprehensive system metrics
4. WHEN an admin navigates THEN they should have access to both user and agent functionalities

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Navigation Logic

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the navigation to adapt to my role automatically, so that I see only relevant options and have an optimized workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system determines user role THEN it should filter menu items accordingly
2. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the sidebar should update dynamically
3. WHEN menu items are filtered THEN the remaining items should maintain proper spacing and organization
4. WHEN role-specific items are shown THEN they should be clearly accessible and properly styled

### Requirement 5: Consistent User Experience

**User Story:** As any system user, I want the sidebar to maintain consistent styling and behavior regardless of role customization, so that the interface feels cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN menu items are customized by role THEN the visual design should remain consistent
2. WHEN items are hidden or renamed THEN the sidebar layout should not break
3. WHEN role-specific customizations are applied THEN the user experience should feel natural
4. WHEN users switch between different sections THEN the navigation should work smoothly
