# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces an intelligent ticket assignment system to the Analy-Ticket platform that automatically distributes tickets to the most suitable agents based on workload, performance metrics, and availability. The system aims to improve response times, balance workload distribution, and optimize customer satisfaction through data-driven assignment decisions while providing administrators with powerful monitoring and rebalancing tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want an intelligent assignment system that automatically assigns tickets to the most suitable agents so that workload is balanced and response times are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a ticket needs assignment THEN the system SHALL analyze all available agents and their current metrics
2. WHEN calculating agent suitability THEN the system SHALL consider workload (40%), performance (30%), and availability (30%) as weighted factors
3. WHEN an agent is at maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL exclude them from assignment consideration
4. WHEN multiple agents are suitable THEN the system SHALL select the one with the highest combined score
5. WHEN no agents are available THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the reason and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a workload dashboard that shows real-time agent metrics so that I can monitor team performance and identify workload imbalances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the workload dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current workload for all agents
2. WHEN viewing agent metrics THEN the system SHALL show active ticket count, utilization percentage, and availability status
3. WHEN displaying team statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate total active tickets, average utilization, and available agent count
4. WHEN workload data is displayed THEN the system SHALL refresh automatically every 30 seconds
5. WHEN an agent is overloaded THEN the system SHALL visually indicate their status with appropriate color coding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want automatic workload rebalancing functionality so that I can redistribute tickets when agents become overloaded or underutilized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating workload rebalancing THEN the system SHALL identify overloaded and underloaded agents
2. WHEN rebalancing workload THEN the system SHALL move low-priority tickets from overloaded to underloaded agents
3. WHEN tickets are reassigned THEN the system SHALL notify both the original and new assignee
4. WHEN rebalancing is complete THEN the system SHALL report the number of tickets reassigned
5. WHEN insufficient agents exist for rebalancing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an agent or administrator, I want an enhanced assignment dialog with AI recommendations so that I can make informed assignment decisions with intelligent suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the assignment dialog THEN the system SHALL provide both intelligent and manual assignment modes
2. WHEN intelligent mode is active THEN the system SHALL display the AI-recommended agent with confidence score and reasoning
3. WHEN viewing agent options THEN the system SHALL show current workload, availability status, and performance metrics
4. WHEN an AI recommendation is available THEN the system SHALL highlight the recommended agent in the selection list
5. WHEN assignment reasoning is displayed THEN the system SHALL explain why a particular agent was recommended

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an agent, I want to receive tickets that match my availability and workload capacity so that I can provide better service without being overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am at maximum ticket capacity THEN the system SHALL NOT assign new tickets to me automatically
2. WHEN I am marked as unavailable THEN the system SHALL exclude me from automatic assignment
3. WHEN tickets are assigned to me THEN the system SHALL consider my current workload and performance history
4. WHEN receiving a new assignment THEN the system SHALL notify me with ticket details and assignment reasoning
5. WHEN my workload becomes unbalanced THEN the system SHALL be able to reassign some tickets to other agents

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want performance-based assignment scoring so that high-performing agents can handle more complex or urgent tickets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating agent scores THEN the system SHALL factor in resolution rate, average resolution time, and customer satisfaction
2. WHEN urgent tickets need assignment THEN the system SHALL prioritize agents with better performance metrics
3. WHEN performance data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL use reasonable default values
4. WHEN displaying agent metrics THEN the system SHALL show resolution rates, average resolution times, and satisfaction scores
5. WHEN performance metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate assignment scores accordingly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the intelligent assignment system to integrate seamlessly with existing workflows so that current processes are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the intelligent assignment system is active THEN existing manual assignment functionality SHALL remain available
2. WHEN agents use current assignment dialogs THEN they SHALL see enhanced features without breaking existing workflows
3. WHEN tickets are assigned through any method THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent notification and logging behavior
4. WHEN assignment fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to manual assignment options
5. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN manual assignment SHALL continue to function normally

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want assignment rule management with database persistence so that I can configure and maintain assignment rules that persist across system restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating assignment rules THEN the system SHALL store them in the database with proper validation
2. WHEN updating assignment rules THEN the system SHALL maintain rule history and audit trails
3. WHEN rules are modified THEN the system SHALL notify affected agents and update assignments accordingly
4. WHEN rules conflict THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution and priority ordering
5. WHEN rules are disabled THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle existing assignments and fall back appropriately

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want real-time assignment monitoring so that I can track system performance and intervene when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assignments are made THEN the system SHALL log assignment decisions with reasoning and confidence scores
2. WHEN assignment patterns change THEN the system SHALL alert administrators to potential issues
3. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and suggested actions
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN administrators SHALL see real-time metrics and assignment queue status
5. WHEN issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want category and subcategory-based auto-assignment so that tickets are automatically routed to specialized agents based on the user's selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a category THEN the system SHALL identify agents with expertise in that category
2. WHEN a user selects a subcategory THEN the system SHALL prioritize agents with specific subcategory experience
3. WHEN multiple agents have category expertise THEN the system SHALL use performance metrics and workload to select the best match
4. WHEN no agents have category expertise THEN the system SHALL fall back to general assignment algorithm
5. WHEN category-based assignment is configured THEN administrators SHALL be able to map categories to specific agents or teams

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure category-to-agent mappings so that I can ensure tickets are routed to the most qualified specialists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring category mappings THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of primary and secondary agents per category
2. WHEN setting subcategory preferences THEN the system SHALL support agent specialization levels (expert, intermediate, basic)
3. WHEN agents are unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically route to secondary agents or escalate appropriately
4. WHEN category mappings change THEN the system SHALL update assignment rules and notify affected agents
5. WHEN viewing category assignments THEN administrators SHALL see agent expertise levels and assignment history
