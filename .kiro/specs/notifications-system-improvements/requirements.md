## Introduction

The current notifications system in Analy-Ticket provides basic functionality for notifying users about ticket events, but has several areas that need improvement. This enhancement will modernize the notification system to provide a more reliable, performant, and user-friendly experience with better real-time capabilities, improved user preferences, enhanced UI/UX, and better error handling.
