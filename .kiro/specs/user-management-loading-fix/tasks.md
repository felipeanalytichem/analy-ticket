# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix route protection for admin access





  - Add `requiredRole="admin"` to the `/admin/users` route in App.tsx
  - Test that non-admin users are properly blocked from accessing the page
  - Verify admin users can access the page without issues
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Create simplified UserManagement component backup



  - Create a backup of the current complex UserManagement component
  - Implement a simplified version with basic functionality
  - Remove complex hooks like `useOptimizedAuth` and `useConsolidatedLoading`
  - Use simple useAuth hook and basic loading states
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 3. Implement basic data loading with error handling





  - Replace complex loading management with simple useEffect and useState
  - Add basic error handling with retry functionality
  - Implement simple loading indicator without flickering
  - Add error boundary to catch component crashes
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.2, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Add fallback UI for component failures





  - Create UserManagementFallback component for when main component fails
  - Implement basic user list display in fallback mode
  - Add retry button and error message display
  - Test fallback component with simulated errors
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Test authentication and authorization flows





  - Test admin user access to the page
  - Test non-admin user blocking (agent and regular user roles)
  - Test unauthenticated user redirection to login
  - Verify loading states during authentication checks
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
-

- [x] 6. Optimize loading performance and user experience




  - Ensure page loads within 3 seconds for admin users
  - Remove unnecessary re-renders and complex state management
  - Add progressive loading for better perceived performance
  - Test loading performance across different network conditions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Implement comprehensive error recovery





  - Add automatic retry with exponential backoff for network failures
  - Handle authentication token refresh transparently
  - Add detailed error logging for debugging purposes
  - Test error recovery scenarios including network failures
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Create tests for the simplified implementation









  - Write unit tests for the simplified UserManagement component
  - Add integration tests for authentication and data loading flows
  - Create manual test cases for admin access verification
  - Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_
