# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Management page is currently not loading properly, preventing administrators from accessing user management functionality. This issue appears to be related to authentication state management, route protection, or component initialization problems. The page may be stuck in a loading state, showing errors, or failing to render entirely.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the User Management page to load reliably and quickly, so that I can access user management features without delays or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator navigates to /admin/users THEN the system SHALL load the page within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the user management interface with all expected components
3. WHEN authentication is valid THEN the system SHALL not show unnecessary loading states or errors
4. WHEN the page fails to load initially THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want proper authentication and authorization checks on the User Management page, so that only authorized users can access the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a non-admin user tries to access /admin/users THEN the system SHALL redirect them or show an access denied message
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the page THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
3. WHEN authentication state is being verified THEN the system SHALL show a clear loading indicator
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the User Management page to handle loading states gracefully, so that I have a smooth user experience without flickering or confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is loading data THEN the system SHALL show a single, stable loading indicator
2. WHEN transitioning between loading and loaded states THEN the system SHALL not flicker or show multiple loading indicators
3. WHEN data fails to load THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error states with retry options
4. WHEN retrying failed operations THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the retry process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the User Management page to be resilient to common issues, so that temporary problems don't prevent me from accessing the functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh transparently
3. WHEN the page encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL restore the page to a functional state without requiring a full page reload
