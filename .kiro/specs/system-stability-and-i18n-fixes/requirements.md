# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses three critical system-wide issues affecting the Analy-Ticket application's usability and functionality: incomplete multilingual translations, data loading loops during navigation, and incomplete agent filtering in ticket management. These issues significantly impact user experience across all user roles and need immediate resolution to maintain system reliability and accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Multilingual Translation Coverage

**User Story:** As a user of the Analy-Ticket system, I want all interface elements to be properly translated into my selected language, so that I can fully understand and navigate the application without encountering untranslated text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects any supported language (English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch, German) THEN the system SHALL display all page content, component labels, buttons, form fields, error messages, and notification text in the selected language
2. WHEN a user navigates to any page or component THEN the system SHALL ensure no hardcoded text remains untranslated
3. WHEN the system displays dynamic content (tickets, categories, user names) THEN the system SHALL translate all static labels and interface elements while preserving user-generated content
4. WHEN a user encounters validation errors or system messages THEN the system SHALL display these messages in the user's selected language
5. WHEN a user accesses cards, modals, tooltips, or any UI component THEN the system SHALL ensure all text elements have proper translation keys assigned

### Requirement 2: Reliable Data Loading and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user navigating the Analy-Ticket system, I want pages to load data consistently when I return from idle states or navigate between sections, so that I can access information without getting stuck in loading loops.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user returns to the application after being idle THEN the system SHALL refresh authentication state and reload page data automatically
2. WHEN a user navigates between sidebar menu items THEN the system SHALL load page data within 3 seconds without entering infinite loading states
3. WHEN a user's session is still valid but data appears stale THEN the system SHALL detect this condition and refresh the data automatically
4. WHEN network connectivity is restored after interruption THEN the system SHALL retry failed data requests and update the UI accordingly
5. WHEN a user encounters a loading loop THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback mechanism to recover or display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN page data fails to load THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Complete Agent Filtering in Ticket Management

**User Story:** As a user viewing "All Agent Tickets", I want the "Assigned Agent" filter to show all current active agents in the system, so that I can properly filter tickets by any agent currently handling support requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the "All Agent Tickets" page THEN the system SHALL load and display all active agents in the "Assigned Agent" filter dropdown
2. WHEN new agents are added to the system THEN the system SHALL include them in the agent filter list immediately
3. WHEN agents are deactivated or removed THEN the system SHALL exclude them from the filter list while preserving historical ticket assignments
4. WHEN the agent filter loads THEN the system SHALL sort agents alphabetically by name for easy selection
5. WHEN a user selects an agent from the filter THEN the system SHALL display only tickets assigned to that specific agent
6. WHEN the agent list is empty or fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and provide a retry mechanism
