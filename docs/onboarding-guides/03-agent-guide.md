Subject: Re: [Ticket #12345] - Email Configuration Issue

Hello [User Name],

Thank you for contacting support regarding your email configuration issue.

I've reviewed your ticket and understand that you're unable to send emails from Outlook with error code 0x80042109. This typically indicates an SMTP authentication problem.

I've scheduled some time to investigate this further and will have an update for you within 2 hours. In the meantime, could you please verify:

1. Your email address: [user@company.com]
2. The exact time when the issue started
3. Whether you can receive emails normally

I'll be in touch soon with next steps.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Support Agent | Analy-Ticket
