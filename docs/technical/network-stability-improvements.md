# Network Stability Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the network stability improvements implemented to address `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` errors and related authentication issues in the Analy-Ticket application.

## Issues Addressed

### Primary Issue: ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES Errors
- **Symptom**: Multiple concurrent requests to the same Supabase endpoint causing resource exhaustion
- **Root Cause**: AuthContext making multiple simultaneous profile loading requests without proper deduplication
- **Impact**: Users experiencing authentication failures and loading loops

### Secondary Issues
- Rapid successive authentication requests during idle state recovery
- Lack of circuit breaker pattern for consecutive failures
- Missing debounce mechanism for idle return handling

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Request Deduplication
**Location**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Added request deduplication to prevent multiple concurrent profile loading requests:

```typescript
// Refs for request deduplication
const isLoadingProfile = useRef<boolean>(false);
const profileLoadPromise = useRef<Promise<boolean> | null>(null);

// Prevent concurrent profile loading requests
if (isLoadingProfile.current && profileLoadPromise.current) {
  console.log('üîê Profile loading already in progress, waiting for existing request...');
  return await profileLoadPromise.current;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates duplicate requests to the same endpoint
- Reduces server load and prevents resource exhaustion
- Improves user experience by avoiding loading loops

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Location**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Implemented circuit breaker to handle consecutive failures:

```typescript
// Circuit breaker: if we've had too many consecutive failures recently, wait before trying
if (consecutiveFailures.current >= 3 && lastFailureTime.current) {
  const timeSinceLastFailure = Date.now() - lastFailureTime.current.getTime();
  const backoffTime = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, consecutiveFailures.current - 3), 30000);
  
  if (timeSinceLastFailure < backoffTime) {
    console.log(`üîê Circuit breaker active, waiting ${Math.round((backoffTime - timeSinceLastFailure) / 1000)}s before retry`);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoffTime - timeSinceLastFailure));
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents cascading failures
- Implements exponential backoff with maximum 30-second delay
- Automatically resets on successful requests

### 3. Debounced Idle Return Handling
**Location**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Added debounce mechanism to prevent rapid successive idle return calls:

```typescript
// Debounce idle return handling to prevent rapid successive calls
idleReturnTimeout.current = setTimeout(async () => {
  // Handle idle return logic
}, 500); // 500ms debounce
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents multiple rapid authentication checks when user returns from idle
- Reduces unnecessary network requests
- Improves system stability during page visibility changes

### 4. Enhanced Network Error Handling
**Location**: `src/lib/networkErrorHandler.ts`

Improved handling of `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` errors:

```typescript
if (errorMessage.includes('ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES') || 
    errorDetails.includes('ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES')) {
  return {
    type: 'insufficient_resources',
    originalError: error,
    retryable: true,
    suggestedDelay: 5000, // Increased from 2000ms to 5000ms
  };
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Longer delay for resource exhaustion errors
- More conservative retry settings (reduced from 3 to 2 max retries)
- Better error classification and handling

### 5. Session Validation Improvements
**Location**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Enhanced session validation to prevent concurrent validations:

```typescript
const validateSession = useCallback(async (): Promise<boolean> => {
  if (isValidatingSession.current) {
    console.log('üîê Session validation already in progress, skipping...');
    return sessionHealth?.isValid || false;
  }
  // ... validation logic
}, []);
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents multiple concurrent session validation requests
- Returns cached session health when validation is in progress
- Reduces network load during session monitoring

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
**Location**: `src/contexts/__tests__/AuthContext.network.test.tsx`

Created comprehensive tests to verify network error handling:

1. **ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES Handling**: Verifies graceful handling of resource exhaustion errors
2. **Request Deduplication**: Ensures only one profile loading request is made at a time
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Validates that consecutive failures trigger backoff behavior
4. **Debounced Idle Return**: Confirms that rapid idle return events are properly debounced

### Test Results
All tests pass, confirming that:
- Network errors are handled gracefully with appropriate retries
- Concurrent requests are properly deduplicated
- Circuit breaker prevents excessive retry attempts
- Idle return handling is properly debounced

## Performance Impact

### Before Improvements
- Multiple concurrent requests to same endpoint
- Cascading failures causing resource exhaustion
- Rapid successive authentication attempts
- Poor user experience with loading loops

### After Improvements
- Single request per operation with deduplication
- Controlled retry behavior with circuit breaker
- Debounced idle return handling
- Improved user experience with stable authentication

## Monitoring and Logging

Enhanced logging provides better visibility into network operations:

```typescript
console.log('üîê Profile loading already in progress, waiting for existing request...');
console.log(`üîê Circuit breaker active, waiting ${Math.round((backoffTime - timeSinceLastFailure) / 1000)}s before retry`);
console.log('üîê Handling return from idle state...');
```

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Network Metrics**: Track the frequency of `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` errors
2. **Adjust Circuit Breaker Settings**: Fine-tune backoff times based on production usage
3. **Consider Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios
4. **Add Metrics Dashboard**: Create monitoring dashboard for network error patterns

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly enhance the network stability of the Analy-Ticket application by:

- Eliminating duplicate requests that cause resource exhaustion
- Implementing intelligent retry mechanisms with circuit breaker patterns
- Providing better error handling and user feedback
- Improving overall system reliability and user experience

The changes are backward compatible and include comprehensive test coverage to ensure continued stability.
