graph TB
    A[New Ticket] --> B{Rules Engine}
    B -->|Rule Match| C[Rule-Based Assignment]
    B -->|No Match| D[Intelligent Assignment]
    C --> E{Agent Available?}
    D --> E
    E -->|Yes| F[Assign Ticket]
    E -->|No| G[Find Alternative]
    F --> H[Send Notifications]
    G --> D

```typescript
totalScore = 
  (workloadScore × 0.25) +
  (performanceScore × 0.25) +
  (availabilityScore × 0.20) +
  (skillMatchScore × 0.15) +
  (customerHistoryScore × 0.15) +
